Step By Step Instructions -

----------------------

basic explanation .bashrc -

.bashrc is a script that runs automatically when you start a new terminal session,
configuring your environment and commands, making your life smoother and more efficient.
This way, everything gets set up whenever you start a new shell session.

what i need to do -

-  Append this to your .bashrc file by adding the following line, copy and paste:
-  Copy  -  . ~/boto_deploy.sh  
-  paste -  .bashrc                

***  the paste need to be at the end of the file (.bashrc)  ***

----------------------

this is how you do it -

1. Open your .bashrc file in your favorite text editor (e.g., nano, vim, or gedit):
        nano ~/.bashrc

2. Add the following line at the end of the .bashrc file:
        . ~/boto_deploy.sh

3. Save and close the file.

4. To apply the changes immediately without restarting the terminal, run:
        source ~/.bashrc

So your .bashrc file will include the following line at the end:
        . ~/boto_deploy.sh
